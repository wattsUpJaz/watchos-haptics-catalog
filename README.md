#  Watch Haptics Catalog
A simple stand-alone watchOS app that plays all the configured haptic events available on the watch. Custom haptics, such as those available via .ahap files on the iPhone are not supported on the watch, so the only way to play haptics on the apple watch is by using these haptic events.
